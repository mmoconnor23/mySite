				In the summer of 2013, my family wanted to go on vacation, so I decided to put together a website to organize our options of places to visit. I had just taken my first semester of computer science that spring and was very excited to try out web development. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This website displays my first attempt at HTML and CSS. It's nothing fancy, just a bunch of static web pages.

				This is a project that I did with a partner for the final project in my Graphics class. It's an Interactive Potter's Wheel. Essentially, you can plot some points, connect them with a line (uses B-splines), and then rotate about an axis to see your 'pot.'

				My lab partner is currently working on porting the project to Mac so that we can run it again. Once it's running, I'll add a link or instructions on how to run it.
